Welcome to X's GitHub repository

X is a revolutionary cloud-based communications platform sponsored by Inktel's Application Services team. 

The primary goal of this platform is to deliver a relevant and current framework for delivering various communications technologies for contact centers. 
As it evolves, part of its road map will include expansion into consumer-facing services.

Key factors for our choice of a technology stack includes:
a. Platform must be highly reliable and empowered by an Open Source technology stack.
b. Platform must support horizontal and vertical scaling with very minimal effort.
c. Platform must not be bound to proprietary licensing costs.

As a result of the aforementioned goals, the technology stack is as follows:
a. Platform will be designed using the Mono Framework
b. Platform will be deployed on the Linux operating system (CentOS or Ubuntu distributions)
c. Platform will be served using the popular Apache Web Server
d. Platform data repository will reside within MySQL databases
